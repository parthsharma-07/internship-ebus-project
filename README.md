## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set Up and Run This Project

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ebus-management-system.git
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.)*

2.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    *   In your new project, enable **Authentication** (with the "Email/Password" provider) and **Cloud Firestore** (start in test mode).

3.  **Configure the Project:**
### 3. Configure the Project:
*   In your Firebase project settings, add a new "Web App".
*   Firebase will give you a `firebaseConfig` object. Copy this entire object.
*   In the project code, go to the `js/` folder. You will see a file named `firebase-config.example.js`.
*   Create a **copy** of this file and rename the copy to `firebase-config.js`.
*   Now, open the new `firebase-config.js` and paste your `firebaseConfig` object into it. **This file is ignored by Git and will not be uploaded.**
4.  **Run the Application:**
    *   Open the project folder in a code editor like VS Code.
    *   Use a local server extension (like **Live Server** or **Live Preview**) to run the `index.html` file.
    *   The application will now be running in your browser.
